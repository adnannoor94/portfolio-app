# About

An interactive react app that represents my frontend skills in form of a protfolio.
Demo: [https://adnannoor.me](https://adnannoor.me)

# The Code Behind

In terms of react, the whole application is divided in 4 major components: **Main, History, Contact, LeftInfoPanel** and **RightMenuPanel**. As the name suggests, each component deals with all the working regarding the named functionality.

CSS is written in SASS for better flexibility of coding style.
